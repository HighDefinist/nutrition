# nutrition
This is an unfinished, but still usable database application, to efficiently browse some of the nutrition data of the USDA database. Note that due to an API change, the data updater no longer works, and the included food data is from around 2019. 
Notable features include:
- Instant GUI update when entering search terms
- Option to normalize service size by energy density, instead of weight
- Option to display values as percentage of recommended daily intake
